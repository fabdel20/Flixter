Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Next time I would like to make the movie descriptions more aesthetically pleasing. 
2. Another additional button can be a light touch so that a pop up comes shows the synopsis of the movie.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had a lot of issues with making the buttons were connected properly. I also had issues at time with the workflow itself. I would confuse myself with which pannels should flow together or how to inherit information.
